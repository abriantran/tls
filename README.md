## Measuring the Usability of TLS Deployment

Computer Security researchers at the University of Michigan and Rice University need participants for a SSL/TLS (Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security) usability research study. Participants will be asked to configure secure Linux web servers using two different approaches, answer questions about them, and complete surveys. The study will take approximately an hour and a half to complete, and participants will be paid $50 for completing the study. To be eligible you must be 18 years of age or older, have normal or corrected-to-normal vision, and have working knowledge of UNIX-like operating systems and Internet infrastructure.
